# A humble command line TODO list

Sometimes you just need a simple reminder.

## Installation
1.    `./install`

      `sudo ./install` if the directory you provide does not allow the normal usero to write to it.

2.    Relaunch your terminal 
      OR

      `source ~/.bash_profile; source ~/.bashrc`

## Usage

- `todo add <thing to do>`  Adds a thing to do
- `todo del`  Asks you what you've done
- `todo`  Shows you the things you need to do
- `todo help`  Shows you what todo can do for you
